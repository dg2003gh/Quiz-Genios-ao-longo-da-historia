            At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
            available on Android ‚Äì the requirements for the system(and for any
            additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app
            to) may change, and you‚Äôll need to download the updates if you want
            to keep using the app. Douglas Guimar√£es does not promise that it
            will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or
            works with the Android version that you have installed on your
            device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the
