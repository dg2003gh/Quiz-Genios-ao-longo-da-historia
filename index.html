            "Gênios ao Longo da História" é um jogo de quiz educacional,
            desenvolvido no Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ensino em Biociências e
            Saúde do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz/Fiocruz, vinculado à tese "Ensino de
            Ciências, altas habilidades e vocação científica: protagonismo
            juvenil no enriquecimento psicopedagógico remoto", desenvolvida pela
            doutoranda Aline Rinco Dutra Salgado sob a orientação da professora
            Dra. Cristina Maria Carvalho Delou. Foi criado por Douglas Gabriel
            O. Guimarães em parceria com Artur Lanini Casarim e Heitor Neves
            Crochet.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Foi projetado para despertar o interesse dos estudantes pela Ciência
            ao apresentar a biografia de dez renomados cientistas, inventores e
            líderes que foram precoces ou autodidatas na infância, de forma
            acessível e interessante, tornando a aprendizagem mais lúdica e
            motivadora. O jogo tem um design atraente e colorido e está
            disponível online, podendo ser acessado por qualquer dispositivo
            conectado à internet.Ele desafia os jogadores a responder perguntas
            relacionadas aos gênios apresentados no almanaque educacional
            associado, em formato de múltipla escolha, com quatro alternativas
            de resposta.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            As perguntas abrangem vários aspectos da vida dos gênios, desde suas
            descobertas e obras até detalhes pessoais e curiosidades. Além do
            desafio do jogo em si, os jogadores também podem aprofundar seus
            conhecimentos sobre esses gênios e a importância de suas
            contribuições para a história e a sociedade. Já o almanaque
            educacional associado inclui fatos históricos, ilustrações,
            curiosidades e sugere materiais complementares, como documentários,
            filmes, jogos online, exposições e museus virtuais, apresentados por
            meio de hyperlinks, tornando a aprendizagem mais dinâmica e
            interativa.

          <p>
            Douglas Guimarães built the Gênios ao longo da história app as an
            Open Source app. This SERVICE is provided by Douglas Guimarães at no
            cost and is intended for use as is.
          </p>
          <p>
            This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the
            collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone
            decided to use my Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection
            and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal
            Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the
            Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except
            as described in this Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in
            our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at Gênios ao longo da
            história unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>
            For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you
            to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The
            information that I request will be retained on your device and is
            not collected by me in any way.
          </p>
          <h4>Log Data</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>
            I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of
            an error in the app I collect data and information (through
            third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data
            may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”)
            address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of
            the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of
            the Service, and other statistics.
          </p>
          <h4>Cookies</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used
            as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from
            the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal
            memory.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the
            app may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to
            collect information and improve their services. You have the option
            to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is
            being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you
            may not be able to use some portions of this Service.
          </p>
          <h4>Service Providers</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>
            I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the
            following reasons:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
            <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
            <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
            <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have
            access to their Personal Information. The reason is to perform the
            tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated
            not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
          </p>
          <h4>Security</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>
            I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus
            we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting
            it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet,
            or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I
            cannot guarantee its absolute security.
          </p>
          <h4>Links to Other Sites</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>
            This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a
            third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these
            external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise
            you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no
            control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy
            policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
          </p>
          <h4>Children’s Privacy</h4>
          <hr />
          <!---->
          <p>
            I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
            children. I encourage all children to never submit any personally
            identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. I
            encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's
            Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their
            children never to provide personally identifiable information
            through the Application and/or Services without their permission. If
            you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally
            identifiable information to us through the Application and/or
            Services, please contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of
            age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable
            information in your country (in some countries we may allow your
            parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).

            I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are
            advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will

          <h4>Terms &amp; Conditions</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>
            By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically
            apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them
            carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify
            the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re
            not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and
            you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages or
            make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks,
            copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights
            related to it, still belong to Douglas Guimarães.
          </p>
          <p>
            Douglas Guimarães is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful
            and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to
            make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time
            and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its
            services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re
            paying for.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Gênios ao longo da história app stores and processes personal
            data that you have provided to us, to provide my Service. It’s your
            responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We
            therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone,
            which is the process of removing software restrictions and
            limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device.
            It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious
            programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could
            mean that the Gênios ao longo da história app won’t work properly or
            at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            You should be aware that there are certain things that Douglas
            Guimarães will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the
            app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The
            connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider,
            but Douglas Guimarães cannot take responsibility for the app not
            working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and
            you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
            remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network
            provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
            mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the
            connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In
            using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges,
            including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your
            home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data
            roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which
            you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
            received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along the same lines, Douglas Guimarães cannot always take
            responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make
            sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and
            you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Douglas Guimarães cannot
            accept responsibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            With respect to Douglas Guimarães’s responsibility for your use of
            the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind
            that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct
            at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to
            us so that we can make it available to you. Douglas Guimarães
            accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you
            experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of
            the app.
          </p>
          <p>
            At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
            available on Android – the requirements for the system(and for any
            additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app
            to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want
            to keep using the app. Douglas Guimarães does not promise that it
            will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or
            works with the Android version that you have installed on your
            device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the
            application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing
            the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving
            notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any
            termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these
            terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed)
            delete it from your device.
