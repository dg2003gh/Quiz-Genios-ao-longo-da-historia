            "Gênios ao Longo da História" is an educational quiz game developed
            in the Graduate Program in Teaching in Biosciences and Health at
            Instituto Oswaldo Cruz/Fiocruz, linked to the thesis "Teaching
            Sciences, high skills and scientific vocation: youth protagonism in
            remote psychopedagogical enrichment," developed by doctoral student
            Aline Rinco Dutra Salgado under the guidance of Professor Dr.
            Cristina Maria Carvalho Delou. Created by Douglas Gabriel O.
            Guimarães in partnership with Artur Lanini Casarim and Heitor Neves

            It was designed to arouse students' interest in science by
            presenting the biography of ten renowned scientists, inventors, and
            leaders who were precocious or self-taught in childhood. It is
            accessible and interesting, making learning more playful and
            motivating. The game has an attractive and colorful design and is
            available online, accessible from any device connected to the
            internet. It challenges players to answer questions related to the
            featured geniuses in the educational almanac associated, in a
            multiple-choice format, with four alternative answers.

            The questions cover various aspects of the geniuses' lives, from
            their discoveries and works to personal details and curiosities.
            Besides the challenge of the game itself, players can also deepen
            their knowledge about these geniuses and the importance of their
            contributions to history and society. The associated educational
            almanac includes historical facts, illustrations, curiosities, and
            suggests complementary materials such as documentaries, films,
            online games, exhibitions, and virtual museums, presented through
            hyperlinks, making learning more dynamic and interactive.

            Don't get sad, probably our game runs on your device. But, for some
            reason, Google Play detects that it doesn't. There are so many
            possibilities, the most common is that your Android version is old
            or your device doesn't meet some specific requirements or even your
            device has specific hardware. Okay then, how can I resolve this
            problem? It's quite simple, perhaps you can't do it through Google
            Play.

            You'll basically need to go to our GitHub repository and download

            may be a little hard, so in the next part of this tutorial, I'll
            show you how to do that.

            Well, you'll probably need the one that has "all" in its name. And
            if you are on an old device, you will need the ".apk" file. If you
            are on a new device, probably the ".abb" file is for you since
            Google Play recommends using it.

            that's not true. The app is totally secure, and it's official from

            to install only apps from Google Play, and that's right in most
            cases, just not in this one. So, when you finish this tutorial,
            please turn the option off in the configuration again for your

            By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically

            carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify
            the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re
            not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and
            you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages or
            make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks,
            copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights
            related to it, still belong to Douglas Guimarães.

            Douglas Guimarães is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful

            make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time
            and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its
            services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re
            paying for.

            The Gênios ao longo da história app stores and processes personal
            data that you have provided to us, to provide my Service. It’s your
            responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We
            therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone,
            which is the process of removing software restrictions and
            limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device.
            It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious
            programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could
            mean that the Gênios ao longo da história app won’t work properly or

          <p translation-key="conditions_terms-fourth-paragraph">
            You should be aware that there are certain things that Douglas
            Guimarães will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the
            app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The
            connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider,
            but Douglas Guimarães cannot take responsibility for the app not
            working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and
            you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p translation-key="conditions_terms-fifth-paragraph">
            If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
            remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network
            provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
            mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the
            connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In
            using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges,
            including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your
            home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data
            roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which
            you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
            received permission from the bill payer for using the app.

          <p translation-key="conditions_terms-sixth-paragraph">
            Along the same lines, Douglas Guimarães cannot always take
            responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make
            sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and
            you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Douglas Guimarães cannot
            accept responsibility.

            With respect to Douglas Guimarães’s responsibility for your use of
            the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind
            that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct
            at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to
            us so that we can make it available to you. Douglas Guimarães
            accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you
            experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of

            At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
            available on Android – the requirements for the system(and for any
            additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app
            to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want
            to keep using the app. Douglas Guimarães does not promise that it
            will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or
            works with the Android version that you have installed on your
            device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the
            application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing
            the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving
            notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any
            termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these
            terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed)
            delete it from your device.
